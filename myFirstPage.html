            <ol>
                <li>piano</li>
                <li>other music</li>
                <li>animals, and especially dogs</li>
                <li>computers, especially programming and especially Python</li>
            </ol>
        I also have a life partner with whom I've been living for the past 18 years.
            He is:
            <ul>
                <li>loving</li>
                <li>caring</li>
                <li>always leaves dirty dishes on the table</li>
            </ul>
